Duncan's notes from 2008, tested on a 2 CPU Sun Netra 240:

* a single apache instance on Solaris 10

  * starting threads:

  * max threads

* 2 load-balanced apache instances on Solaris 10

* twisted.web instances on Solaris 10 (same docroot)

* 2 load-balanced twisted.web instances

* PythonDirector 1.0.0 proxies for 2 load-balanced twisted.web instances

Anthony's original notes on performance:

* On my notebook, load balancing an apache on the same local ethernet
  (serving a static 18K text file) gets 155 connections per second and
  2850 kbytes/s throughput (apachebench -n 2000 -c 10). Connecting directly
  to the apache gets 180 conns/sec and 3400kbytes/s. So unless you're
  serving really really stupidly high hit rates it's unlikely to be
  pythondirector causing you difficulties. (Note that 155 connections/sec
  is 13 million hits per day...)

* Running purely over the loopback interface to a local apache seems to
  max out at around 350 conns/second.
