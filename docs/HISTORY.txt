Changes
=======

From txLoadBalancer 1.1.1 to 1.2.0
----------------------------------

* Down-ed hosts are now re-checked before they are put back into rotation; only
  hosts with no connection problems are re-added.

* The use of setuptools is now optional.

From txLoadBalancer 1.0.1 to 1.1.0
----------------------------------

* Massive API changes: competely reorganzied the code base.

* Integrated patches from Apple's Calendar Server project.

* A new API for creating load-balanced services within a Twisted application
  (without the need to run a separate load-balancingn daemon).

* Added support for live interaction with load-balancer via SSH connection to
  running Python interpretter (Twisted manhole).

* The ability to start listening on a new port without restaring the
  application.

* Added a weighted load balance scheduler.

From txLoadBalancer 0.9.1 to 1.0.1
----------------------------------

* 100% Twisted: removed all threading and asyncore code completely.

* Significan API changes.

* Dropped the web API.

From PyDirector 1.0.0 to 1.1.1 (AKA txLoadBalancer 0.9.1)
---------------------------------------------------------

* Added support for Twisted, providing the option for all management, admin and
  load-balancing to utilize the Twisted reactor, skipping threading and asycore
  altogether.

From PyDirector 0.0.7 to 1.0.0
------------------------------

* Very few, mostly this is to update the project to 'stable' status.

* The networking code now uses twisted if available, and falls back
  to asyncore.

From PyDirector 0.0.6 to 0.0.7
------------------------------

* You can specify a hostname of '*' to the listen directive for both
  the scheduler and the administrative interface to mean 'listen on
  all interfaces'. Considerably more obvious than '0.0.0.0'. Thanks
  to Andrew Sydelko for the idea.

* New "leastconnsrr" scheduler - this is leastconns, with a roundrobin
  as well. Previously, leastconns would keep the list of hosts sorted,
  which often meant one system got beaten up pretty badly.

* Twisted backend group selection works again.

* The client address is now passed to the scheduler's getHost() method.
  This allows the creation of "sticky" schedulers, where a client is
  (by preference) sent to the same backend server. The factory function
  for schedulers will change to allow things like "roundrobin,sticky".

From PyDirector 0.0.5 to 0.0.6
------------------------------

* fixed an error in the (hopefully rare) case where all backend servers
  are down.

* the main script uses resource.setrlimit() to boost the number of open
  filedescriptors (solaris has stupidly low defaults)

* when all backend servers are down, the manager thread goes into a much
  more aggressive mode re-adding them.

* handle comments in the config file

From PyDirector 0.0.4 to 0.0.5
------------------------------

* bunch of bugfixes to the logging

* re-implemented the networking code using the 'twisted' framework; a simple
  loopback test with asyncore based pydir:

      Requests per second:    107.72
      Transfer rate:          2462.69 kb/s received

  the same test with twisted-based pydir:

      Requests per second:    197.90
      Transfer rate:          4519.69 kb/s received

From PyDirector 0.0.3 to 0.0.4
------------------------------

* can now specify more than one listener for a service

* 'client' in the config XML is now 'host'

* fixed a bug in leastconns and roundrobin scheduler if all backends
  were unavailable.

* whole lotta documentation added.

* running display in web api now shows count of total connections

* running display now has refresh and auto-refresh

* compareconf module - takes a running config and a new config and
  emits the web api commands needed to make the running config match
  the new config

* first cut at enabling https for web interface (needs m2crypto)

From PyDirector 0.0.2 to 0.0.3
------------------------------

* delHost hooked up

* running.xml added - XML dump of current config

* centralised logging - the various things that write logfile
  entries need to be made consistent, and a lot of additional
  logging needs to be added.

* Python2.1 compatibility fix: no socket.gaierror exception on 2.1

From PyDirector 0.0.1 to 0.0.2
------------------------------

* refactored web publishing (babybobo)

* package-ised and distutil-ised the code
