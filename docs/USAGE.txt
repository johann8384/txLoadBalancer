Usage
=====

To get started with the sample script, just do the following::

    $ twistd -noy ./bin/txlb.tac

This will use the default configuration file in ./etc/config.xml; you can edit
the .tac file to point to the config you prefer. Be sure to edit the
config.xml file to properly reflect your services in need of load-balancing.

To enable the admin interface, your config file must have the admin section
defined, with the required fields. For an example, be sure to see
./etc/config.xml. For more details, please see the configuration information in
the ./doc directory.

If you are creating your own script and don't want to use txlb.tac, you can
import the application setup functions in txlb.application.

You can also "embed" a load-balancer in your Twisted application, though in
it's current state this is rather limited. For example, if you had started web
servers on three other hosts, your main application could lood balance them in
the following manner::

    from twisted.application import service

    from txlb import manager
    from txlb.model import HostMapper
    from txlb.schedulers import leastc
    from txlb.application.service import LoadBalancedService

    proxyServices = [
      HostMapper(proxy='127.0.0.1:8080', lbType=leastc, host='host1',
          address='10.0.0.1:80'),
      HostMapper(proxy='127.0.0.1:8080', lbType=leastc, host='host2',
          address='10.0.0.2:80'),
      HostMapper(proxy='127.0.0.1:8080', lbType=leastc, host='host3',
          address='10.0.0.3:80'),
    ]

    application = service.Application('Demo LB Service')
    pm = manager.proxyManagerFactory(proxyServices)
    lbs = LoadBalancedService(pm)
    lbs.setServiceParent(application)
